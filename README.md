# my_bcd_clock
Project of a bcd clock

## Description
This is a project i am doing to learn some stuffs (like GIT, markdown, doxygen, ...) and enhance other skills (pcb drawning, c programming, ...). The project itself is kinda simple, but this way i can focus on the tools i am using. 
For example: in firmware i am using things i learned like structs, pointers, pointers to functions, etc, trying to write a organized firmware.

## Repository structure
For now, the repository is divided in two directories: "hardware" and "firmware".

### ./hardware
This folder contains the all files about hardware, like schematics, datasheets, etc

### ./firmware
This folder contains all files about firmware, like source files, documents, project files, etc
